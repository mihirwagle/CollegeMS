College Management System
=========================

This application was developed as a part of my 6th semester projects in Distributed Datababases. 
We were given freedom to code the UI in any language we want. 
The only constraint was that the backend should be Oracle 11g.

Despite being more accustomed to web development, I chose to use Java Swings via Netbeans since it afforded me an easy to use drag and drop interface for making the UI.

Making a web project is possible but the PHP support for the same is flaky. In case you want to do the same, consider using nodejs which is well supported.

Setting up project on your system ->
  * Download and install Oracle 11g Express Edition.
  * Remember the password you set for system.(I used *oracle*).
  * Fork this project and clone it to your system.
  * Start the database using **Start Database**
  * Open the **SQL CommandLine**
  * In the forked project, navigate to src folder.
  * Run the sql file **exec.sql**.
  * This will setup your database for you.
  * Place the **ojdbc6.jar** file into the root of your C drive
  * Now import your project into Netbeans.
  * I used Netbeans 8.2
  * Run the project!
  * That's about it.

I hope this helped!
